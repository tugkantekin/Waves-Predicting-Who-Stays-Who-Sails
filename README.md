‚ÄúWorkforce Waves: Predicting Who Stays & Who Sails‚Äù 
Using the IBM HR Analytics Attrition dataset, I conducted an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover the key factors influencing employee attrition.

üìä Key highlights from the project:

Clear visualizations of workforce demographics and trends
Insights into how job roles, departments, overtime, and promotions affect retention
A holistic view of employee engagement, showing generally high satisfaction levels but also critical risk areas

 Why this matters:
 For HR leaders and managers, understanding attrition patterns is essential for designing effective retention strategies and fostering a healthier workplace culture. Data-driven insights can help organizations reduce turnover, optimize engagement, and support long-term growth.
