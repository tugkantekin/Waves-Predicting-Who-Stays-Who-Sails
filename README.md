Workforce Waves: Predicting Who Stays & Who Sails 🌊

📌 Project Overview

This project leverages the IBM HR Analytics Attrition Dataset to explore the factors that influence employee attrition. The analysis is conducted entirely through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), using data visualization and statistical summaries to uncover insights into employee engagement, retention, and workforce dynamics.

Unlike predictive modeling projects, the focus here is on understanding patterns and providing business-oriented insights that can support HR managers and decision-makers in designing effective retention strategies.

🎯 Objectives

Examine workforce demographics and overall attrition trends

Identify the roles, departments, and conditions most associated with employee turnover

Explore the impact of factors such as overtime, promotion history, and work-life balance

Provide actionable insights for HR and business leaders to improve employee retention

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Seaborn & Matplotlib for data visualization

Jupyter Notebook / Kaggle environment

📊 Key Insights

Overall attrition rates are relatively low, but certain departments and roles face higher turnover risks.

Work-life balance, promotion opportunities, and overtime show a strong relationship with attrition.

Higher employee engagement generally correlates with lower turnover.
